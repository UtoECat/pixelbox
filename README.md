typical sandbox? maybe.     
I've always wanted to work on *shaders and 2D sandboxes*... And this project combines **both**. So far, only the *most basic things* have been done - graphics, sound, a convenient wrapper for loading and managing textures and shaders, a simple container for the game world, and... it works. theoretically, you can already try to make the world 10,000 by 10,000... but of course *it will be unplayable and slow :)* there is still a huge scope for optimizations.

But the main problems for me now are the *creation of this world and its rules*. I'm not sure how much to bother with this, but I really want to try to make *liquids, gases, physical objects* in addition to ordinary sand, as it is now. but I don't fully understand how :D   

Do you have any ideas? Highly desirable in code/pseudo-code equivalent xD.

# building
First, open the makfile and change some variables (compiler, debug or release build...). Then
```bash
$ make
```
Will start build process for u :p
